# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
*I had to get a lot of help from my Turing graduate SIL with this assignment. I spent several hours trying to work it out myself but had a hard time understanding what parts of the code matched the new terminology we were learning. After she helped me understand that, things went smoother
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
*Better. I am remembering to take breaks, especially when I can feel my mind getting fatigued. Work/school balance has been a bit tricky but only 6 more days before I can full time Turing :)
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
*I feel like I have a lot of support. I need to get my work space sussed out so it is a more comfortable and purposeful room (smaller day bed, punching bag, table need to desk to hold things I don't need every 5 minutes). I am getting my calendar fleshed out to account for extra study times, homework, meetups with cohort mates, etc.
